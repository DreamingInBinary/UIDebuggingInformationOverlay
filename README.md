# UIDebuggingInformationOverlay
A simple category to toggle the UIKit debugger tucked away inside of UIKit's private headers, as discovered by Ryan Peterson's blog post [here](http://ryanipete.com/blog/ios/swift/objective-c/uidebugginginformationoverlay/).

It should go without saying, but use this at your own risk. It can do some nifty stuff though, so have fun!
